(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe court is back in session after a lunch break and opening statements are expected to begin soon in the historic defamation lawsuit brought by election technology company Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the high-stakes case:\n\nWhy is Dominion suing Fox News? Dominion sued Fox News in 2021 over the right-wing network’s repeated promotion of false claims about the company, including that its voting machines rigged the 2020 election by flipping millions of ballots from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. Most of the 20 allegedly defamatory broadcasts mentioned in the lawsuit occurred in November and December 2020.\n\nThe company alleges that people at Fox News acted with actual malice and “recklessly disregarded the truth” when they spread this disinformation about Dominion. To prove “actual malice,” Dominion must convince a jury that people at Fox News who were responsible for these 20 broadcasts knew the Dominion claims were false or recklessly disregarded evidence of falsity — but put them on-air anyway.\n\nAccording to Dominion’s theory of the case, Fox promoted these election conspiracy theories because “the lies were good for Fox’s business.” Dominion’s suit specifically zeroed in on shows hosted by Lou Dobbs, Maria Bartiromo, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, and Jeanine Pirro. Dominion said that as a result of Fox’s “orchestrated defamatory campaign” it has suffered “enormous and irreparable economic harm” and that its employees have been subjected to death threats and harassment.\n\nWhat is Fox’s defense? Fox said it didn’t defame anyone and that the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms.\n\nA spokesperson for Fox has said the network “is proud of our 2020 election coverage” and that its coverage “stands in the highest tradition of American journalism.” The company said, “Dominion’s lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost would be cherished First Amendment rights.”\n\nFox has also accused Dominion of generating “noise and confusion” around the case, stating, “the core of this case remains about freedom of the press and freedom of speech, which are fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution,” specifically the First Amendment.\n\nFox has attempted to get the lawsuit tossed. But in a major blow to the right-wing network last month, the judge overseeing the case has allowed it to go to trial. He has also prohibited Fox from invoking some key First Amendment defenses, finding they were without merit.\n\nWhat is Dominion asking for? Dominion is seeking $1.6 billion in damages. They say Fox’s on-air lies destroyed its reputation and is causing election officials to cancel their Dominion contracts. CNN recently reported on the growing distrust in voting machines in heavily Republican counties.\n\nWhat are the trial logistics? The trial is expected to last five to six weeks and will be overseen by Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric M. Davis, who was appointed to the state bench in 2012 by a Democratic governor. A panel of 12 jurors and 12 alternates is being seated.\n\nCameras are not allowed in the courtroom and there will not be any video of the proceedings. There also won’t be any still photography inside the courtroom.\n\nWho is expected to testify? Expected witness include Fox Corporation executives Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch; Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott and president Jay Wallace; prominent TV hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Maria Bartiromo, Lou Dobbs, Jeanine Pirro, and Bret Baier, among others.\n\nDominion said it might also call Viet Dinh, Fox’s chief legal officer, and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Fox board member, to the witness stand.\n\nBoth sides are also hoping to put on testimony from their handpicked experts who specialize in election statistics, the security of voting machines, journalism ethics, the impact of disinformation in public discourse, and more.\n\nRead more about the case here.",

    "content": "CNN —\n\nFor all the interest in big-name witnesses and eye-opening private text messages, at the core of the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News are 20 specific broadcasts and tweets in which the voting company says Fox knowingly promoted lies, destroying its reputation.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, all 20 statements took place between November 8, 2020, and January 26, 2021, and came in the form of on-air comments from Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo; interviews with prominent pro-Trump election deniers Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell; and several of Dobbs’ tweets.\n\nThe wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories: that Dominion conducted election fraud, that it used algorithms to flip votes, that it had ties to Venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company.\n\nThe judge overseeing the defamation trial has already ruled that these allegations were false, saying it is “CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.”\n\nAt trial, it will be a jury’s job to determine if the statements were made with “actual malice” – a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth – and potentially award damages. Dominion has asked for $1.6 billion in damages and additional punitive damages, a number Fox says is wildly overblown.\n\nFox has denied wrongdoing and said the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. Lawyers for Fox have argued that Dominion hasn’t come close to clearing the high bar to prove defamation.\n\nHere’s a closer look at those 20 specific broadcasts and tweets of alleged defamation.\n\nBroadcast 1: Bartiromo interviews Powell\n\nMaria Bartiromo is involved in three broadcasts that Dominion says were defamatory. Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nThe broadcast: “Sunday Morning Futures” on November 8, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and algorithm flips.\n\nKey false quote: “Sidney, we talked about the Dominion software. I know that there were voting irregularities. Tell me about that,” Bartiromo said.\n\n“That’s to put it mildly. The computer glitches could not and should not have happened at all,” Powell said. “That is where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.”\n\nBroadcast 2: Dobbs interviews Giuliani\n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 12, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “So, we’re using a foreign company that is owned by Venezuelans who are close to – were close to (Hugo) Chávez, are now close to (Nicolás) Maduro, have a history. They were founded as a company to fix elections, they have a terrible record, and they are extremely hackable,” Giuliani said.\n\nBroadcast 3: Dobbs interviews Powell\n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 13, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\n\nKey false quote: “Let’s start with Dominion, a straight out disavowal of any claim of fraud against the company, its software or machines. Your reaction,” Dobbs asked.\n\n“Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion, starting with the fact it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for Hugo Chavez and then shipped internationally to manipulate votes for purchase in other countries, including this one,” Powell said.\n\n“We also need to look at and we’re beginning to collect evidence on the financial interests of some of the governors and Secretaries of State who actually bought into the Dominion Systems … to line their own pockets by getting a voting machine in that would either make sure their election was successful or they got money for their family from it,” she added.\n\n“Well, that’s straightforward,” Dobbs said. “You’re going to have to be quick to go through and to produce that investigation and the results of it.”\n\nBroadcast 4: Tweet from Dobbs\n\nLou Dobbs was involved in 12 allegedly defamatory statements, Dominion said in its lawsuit. Steven Ferdman/Getty Images\n\nThe broadcast: Quote-tweet by Dobbs of Giuliani tweet on November 14, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “Did you know a foreign company, DOMINION, was counting our vote in Michigan, Arizona and Georgia and other states,” Giuliani wrote.\n\n“Read all about Dominion and Smartmatic voting companies and you’ll soon understand how pervasive this Democrat electoral fraud is, and why there’s no way in the world the 2020 Presidential election was either free or fair. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump #AmericaFirst #Dobbs,” Dobbs wrote.\n\nBroadcast 5: Jeanine Pirro interviews Powell\n\nThe broadcast: “Justice with Judge Jeanine” on November 14, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “It was created for the express purpose of being able to alter votes and secure the reelection of Hugo Chavez and then Maduro. They’ve used it in Argentina,” Powell said. “There is an American citizen who has exported it to other countries and it is one huge, huge criminal conspiracy that should be investigated by military intelligence for its national security implications.”\n\n“Yes. And hopefully the Department of Justice, but who knows anymore,” Pirro said.\n\nBroadcast 6: Bartiromo previews interview with Powell and Giuliani\n\nThe broadcast: “Fox & Friends Sunday” on November 15, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\n\nKey false quote: “Sidney Powell is also talking about potential kickbacks that government officials, who were asked to use Dominion, actually also enjoyed benefits to their families,” Bartiromo said. “We’re going to talk about that coming up as well.”\n\nBroadcast 7: Bartiromo interviews Giuliani and Powell\n\nThe broadcast: “Sunday Morning Futures” on November 15, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\n\nKey false quote: “We have sworn witness testimony of why the software was designed. It was designed to rig elections … We have so much evidence, I feel like it’s coming in through a fire hose,” Powell said.\n\n“Wow,” Bartiromo said.\n\nBroadcast 8: Dobbs interviews Powell\n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 16, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “I’ve just gotten some stunning evidence from a firsthand witness, a high-ranking military officer, who was present when Smartmatic was designed in a way that – and I’m going to just read to you some of these statements, if you don’t mind, so I get them exactly right,” Powell said.\n\n“Sure,” Dobbs said.\n\nPowell continued, “From the affidavit, (Smartmatic was) ‘designed in a way that the system could change the vote of each voter without being detected.’”\n\nPowell also incorrectly claimed that Smartmatic owns Dominion.\n\nBroadcast 9: Dobbs interviews Giuliani\n\nStatements from Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City Mayor and attorney to President Donald Trump, are at issue in six of the 20 broadcasts. Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 18, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “But I mean just the mere fact that we have a foreign country, we had this in a foreign country, done by friends of an enemy of the United States, Maduro, is outrageous and has to stop immediately,” Giuliani said.\n\n“It’s outrageous,” Dobbs said.\n\nBroadcast 10: Dobbs interviews Powell\n\nFox Business host Lou Dobbs conducts a phone interview with pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell during the November 19, 2020, edition of \"Lou Dobbs Tonight.\" Fox News/court filings\n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 19, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “Let me put it this way, there are thousands of people in federal prisons on far less evidence of criminal conduct than we have already against the Smartmatic and Dominion Systems companies,” Powell said.\n\nBroadcast 11: Pirro monologue\n\nJeanine Pirro speaks during 2022 FOX Nation Patriot Awards on November 17, 2022. Jason Koerner/Getty Images\n\nThe broadcast: “Justice with Judge Jeanine” on November 21, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “The President’s lawyers alleging a company called Dominion, which they say started in Venezuela with Cuban money, and with the assistance of Smartmatic software, a backdoor is capable of flipping votes,” Pirro said.\n\nBroadcast 12: Dobbs interviews Powell\n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 24, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “We are just continuing to be inundated by evidence of all the frauds here and every manner and means of fraud you could possibly think of,” Powell said.\n\n“I think many Americans have given no thought to electoral fraud that would be perpetrated through electronic voting; that is, these machines, these electronic voting companies, including Dominion, prominently Dominion, at least in the suspicions of a lot of Americans,” Dobbs said.\n\nBroadcast 13: Dobbs interview with Powell\n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 30, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, kickbacks.\n\nKey false quote: “Different states shaved different amounts of votes, or the system was set up to shave and flip different votes in different states,” Powell said. “Some people were targeted as individual candidates.

    "full_text": "CNN —\n\nFor all the interest in big-name witnesses and eye-opening private text messages, at the core of the defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News are 20 specific broadcasts and tweets in which the voting company says Fox knowingly promoted lies, destroying its reputation.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, all 20 statements took place between November 8, 2020, and January 26, 2021, and came in the form of on-air comments from Fox hosts Jeanine Pirro, Lou Dobbs and Maria Bartiromo; interviews with prominent pro-Trump election deniers Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and Mike Lindell; and several of Dobbs’ tweets.\n\nThe wild allegations in the statements fell into four broad categories: that Dominion conducted election fraud, that it used algorithms to flip votes, that it had ties to Venezuela and that politicians received kickbacks to use the company.\n\nThe judge overseeing the defamation trial has already ruled that these allegations were false, saying it is “CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.”\n\nAt trial, it will be a jury’s job to determine if the statements were made with “actual malice” – a high bar based on knowing falseness or having a reckless disregard for the truth – and potentially award damages. Dominion has asked for $1.6 billion in damages and additional punitive damages, a number Fox says is wildly overblown.\n\nFox has denied wrongdoing and said the case is a meritless assault on press freedoms. Lawyers for Fox have argued that Dominion hasn’t come close to clearing the high bar to prove defamation.\n\nHere’s a closer look at those 20 specific broadcasts and tweets of alleged defamation.\n\nBroadcast 1: Bartiromo interviews Powell\n\nMaria Bartiromo is involved in three broadcasts that Dominion says were defamatory. Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nThe broadcast: “Sunday Morning Futures” on November 8, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and algorithm flips.\n\nKey false quote: “Sidney, we talked about the Dominion software. I know that there were voting irregularities. Tell me about that,” Bartiromo said.\n\n“That’s to put it mildly. The computer glitches could not and should not have happened at all,” Powell said. “That is where the fraud took place where they were flipping votes in the computer system or adding votes that did not exist.”\n\nBroadcast 2: Dobbs interviews Giuliani\n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 12, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “So, we’re using a foreign company that is owned by Venezuelans who are close to – were close to (Hugo) Chávez, are now close to (Nicolás) Maduro, have a history. They were founded as a company to fix elections, they have a terrible record, and they are extremely hackable,” Giuliani said.\n\nBroadcast 3: Dobbs interviews Powell\n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 13, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\n\nKey false quote: “Let’s start with Dominion, a straight out disavowal of any claim of fraud against the company, its software or machines. Your reaction,” Dobbs asked.\n\n“Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion, starting with the fact it was created to produce altered voting results in Venezuela for Hugo Chavez and then shipped internationally to manipulate votes for purchase in other countries, including this one,” Powell said.\n\n“We also need to look at and we’re beginning to collect evidence on the financial interests of some of the governors and Secretaries of State who actually bought into the Dominion Systems … to line their own pockets by getting a voting machine in that would either make sure their election was successful or they got money for their family from it,” she added.\n\n“Well, that’s straightforward,” Dobbs said. “You’re going to have to be quick to go through and to produce that investigation and the results of it.”\n\nBroadcast 4: Tweet from Dobbs\n\nLou Dobbs was involved in 12 allegedly defamatory statements, Dominion said in its lawsuit. Steven Ferdman/Getty Images\n\nThe broadcast: Quote-tweet by Dobbs of Giuliani tweet on November 14, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “Did you know a foreign company, DOMINION, was counting our vote in Michigan, Arizona and Georgia and other states,” Giuliani wrote.\n\n“Read all about Dominion and Smartmatic voting companies and you’ll soon understand how pervasive this Democrat electoral fraud is, and why there’s no way in the world the 2020 Presidential election was either free or fair. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump #AmericaFirst #Dobbs,” Dobbs wrote.\n\nBroadcast 5: Jeanine Pirro interviews Powell\n\nThe broadcast: “Justice with Judge Jeanine” on November 14, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “It was created for the express purpose of being able to alter votes and secure the reelection of Hugo Chavez and then Maduro. They’ve used it in Argentina,” Powell said. “There is an American citizen who has exported it to other countries and it is one huge, huge criminal conspiracy that should be investigated by military intelligence for its national security implications.”\n\n“Yes. And hopefully the Department of Justice, but who knows anymore,” Pirro said.\n\nBroadcast 6: Bartiromo previews interview with Powell and Giuliani\n\nThe broadcast: “Fox & Friends Sunday” on November 15, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\n\nKey false quote: “Sidney Powell is also talking about potential kickbacks that government officials, who were asked to use Dominion, actually also enjoyed benefits to their families,” Bartiromo said. “We’re going to talk about that coming up as well.”\n\nBroadcast 7: Bartiromo interviews Giuliani and Powell\n\nThe broadcast: “Sunday Morning Futures” on November 15, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties, kickbacks.\n\nKey false quote: “We have sworn witness testimony of why the software was designed. It was designed to rig elections … We have so much evidence, I feel like it’s coming in through a fire hose,” Powell said.\n\n“Wow,” Bartiromo said.\n\nBroadcast 8: Dobbs interviews Powell\n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 16, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “I’ve just gotten some stunning evidence from a firsthand witness, a high-ranking military officer, who was present when Smartmatic was designed in a way that – and I’m going to just read to you some of these statements, if you don’t mind, so I get them exactly right,” Powell said.\n\n“Sure,” Dobbs said.\n\nPowell continued, “From the affidavit, (Smartmatic was) ‘designed in a way that the system could change the vote of each voter without being detected.’”\n\nPowell also incorrectly claimed that Smartmatic owns Dominion.\n\nBroadcast 9: Dobbs interviews Giuliani\n\nStatements from Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City Mayor and attorney to President Donald Trump, are at issue in six of the 20 broadcasts. Roy Rochlin/Getty Images\n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 18, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “But I mean just the mere fact that we have a foreign country, we had this in a foreign country, done by friends of an enemy of the United States, Maduro, is outrageous and has to stop immediately,” Giuliani said.\n\n“It’s outrageous,” Dobbs said.\n\nBroadcast 10: Dobbs interviews Powell\n\nFox Business host Lou Dobbs conducts a phone interview with pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell during the November 19, 2020, edition of \"Lou Dobbs Tonight.\" Fox News/court filings\n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 19, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “Let me put it this way, there are thousands of people in federal prisons on far less evidence of criminal conduct than we have already against the Smartmatic and Dominion Systems companies,” Powell said.\n\nBroadcast 11: Pirro monologue\n\nJeanine Pirro speaks during 2022 FOX Nation Patriot Awards on November 17, 2022. Jason Koerner/Getty Images\n\nThe broadcast: “Justice with Judge Jeanine” on November 21, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “The President’s lawyers alleging a company called Dominion, which they say started in Venezuela with Cuban money, and with the assistance of Smartmatic software, a backdoor is capable of flipping votes,” Pirro said.\n\nBroadcast 12: Dobbs interviews Powell\n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 24, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, Venezuela ties.\n\nKey false quote: “We are just continuing to be inundated by evidence of all the frauds here and every manner and means of fraud you could possibly think of,” Powell said.\n\n“I think many Americans have given no thought to electoral fraud that would be perpetrated through electronic voting; that is, these machines, these electronic voting companies, including Dominion, prominently Dominion, at least in the suspicions of a lot of Americans,” Dobbs said.\n\nBroadcast 13: Dobbs interview with Powell\n\nThe broadcast: “Lou Dobbs Tonight” on November 30, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud, algorithm flips, kickbacks.\n\nKey false quote: “Different states shaved different amounts of votes, or the system was set up to shave and flip different votes in different states,” Powell said. “Some people were targeted as individual candidates. It’s really the most massive and historical egregious fraud the world has ever seen.”\n\nBroadcast 14: Sean Hannity interviews Powell\n\nThe broadcast: “Hannity” on November 30, 2020.\n\nWhat they alleged: Election fraud and algorithm flips.\n\nKey false quote: “The machine ran an algorithm that shaved votes from Trump and awarded them to Biden,” Powell said. “They used the machines to trash large batches of votes that should have been awarded to President Trump.

    "content": "CNN —\n\nMillions of Americans could face massive consequences unless Speaker Kevin McCarthy can navigate out of a debt trap he has set for President Joe Biden that is instead threatening to capture his House Republicans.\n\nThe California Republican traveled to Wall Street on Monday to deliver a fresh warning that the House GOP majority will refuse to lift a cap on government borrowing unless Biden agrees to spending cuts that would effectively neutralize his domestic agenda and neuter his White House legacy.\n\nMcCarthy also assured traders, however, that he would never let the US government default on its obligations – a potential disaster that could halt Social Security payments, trigger a recession and unleash job cuts by the fall in the event that the debt ceiling is not raised.\n\nThis is where the risk to Americans comes in. It’s hard to see how a rookie speaker, with a tiny majority and a conference containing plenty of extremists, can engineer either of these outcomes.\n\nMost countries don’t require the legislature to raise the government’s borrowing threshold. But the quirky situation in the US has made a once routine duty an opportunity for political mischief in a polarized age. Since the government spends more than it makes in revenue, it must borrow money to service its debt and pay for spending that Congress has already authorized. It has no problem getting more credit since the US pays its bills and has always had a stellar credit rating, despite one previous downgrade from the threat of default.\n\nAt least, that’s the way it has worked until now.\n\nMcCarthy beseeched his conference in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to line up behind a bill that would raise the debt limit for a year but require a flurry of spending concessions from Biden. He styled the measure as an initial way of forcing the president to the negotiating table. But the bill is purely tactical since it’s got no chance of passing the Democratic-led Senate.\n\nBut in a sign of how difficult it will be for the speaker to even pull this gambit off, there were signs of internal disagreement on what should be in the package among GOP members.\n\nRep. Scott Perry, the chairman of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, was frustrated about a lack of specificity in the plan and wanted steeper cuts.\n\n“I don’t know what’s in the package completely. That’s the issue,” Perry told reporters. Some members seem reluctant to commit so far. Conservative Rep. Tim Burchett told CNN’s Manu Raju, “I’m open to it but I’m still a ‘no’ vote.”\n\nIt is not unusual for various factions in a congressional majority to haggle over details before a final package is agreed. And House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry, a McCarthy ally, was confident the plan would pass the House. “The question is, what does the White House then do once we pass this package? We’ve clearly stated there is no clean debt ceiling that will pass the House,” he added. “So we’ll have the first opening offer here. And we’ll see if the president’s willing to come to the table and negotiate like previous presidents have.”\n\nMcHenry’s comment, however, reflected a big flaw in the GOP strategy since it relies on McCarthy’s belief that Biden will have no choice but to come to the table. The White House has insisted the House should do its job and pass a simple bill that only raises the borrowing limit\n\nIn effect, McCarthy has already set up a severe test of his leadership since there’s no guarantee that he can pass the measure in a House where he can only lose four votes and in which there are few signs the fractious GOP can agree on what programs to cut and by how much. And even if the measure does squeeze through the House in the coming weeks, it will likely be an idealized Republican product on which Biden and the Democratic Senate will never bite. Any subsequent package that emerged would almost certainly feature concessions that could splinter its GOP support.\n\nStill, the speaker was typically bullish when he predicted Monday he’d have the votes to pass his initial bill.\n\n“I think we got 218 to raise the debt ceiling,” McCarthy told CNN. “We’ve got a lot of consensus within the conference. We’ll get together and work through it.”\n\nHis assurances may not be very reassuring, however, because his similarly blithe predictions that he had the votes to win the speakership in January degenerated into a farcical process that saw him make huge concessions to his party’s most radical members and required 15 ballots before he finally won the job of his dreams.\n\nBut with the debt ceiling, it will be Americans’ livelihoods and the global economy, rather than McCarthy’s immediate political ambitions, that are on the line.\n\nRepublicans are yet to agree on their own demands\n\nSo far, Republicans seem to be having trouble negotiating with themselves, let alone Biden. Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, who is helping to fashion the GOP’s position, said that while the party hopes to pass the initial bill next week, challenges remain.\n\n“I think the hardest part is just that there are an unlimited number of conservative policy victories that, of course, we all want to see worked in,” Johnson told CNN’s Manu Raju. “The reality is that in a negotiation, you never get everything you want. And so I think our biggest issue right now is how do we squeeze these thousands of desires down to a manageable and credible number of asks?”\n\nAnother complication is that some members of the Republican conference have said they will never vote to raise the debt ceiling on principle – no matter what. In a powerful Republican majority such holdouts could be ignored. In McCarthy’s narrow majority – secured after a 2022 midterm election that fell short of GOP expectations – they have real leverage. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they’d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldn’t risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster.\n\nThe coming showdown over the debt ceiling is potentially the defining moment in the two-year period of uneasy cohabitation between the Democratic president and Republican speaker. Neither Biden nor McCarthy can afford to lose, and the outcome will shape both their legacies.\n\nRepublicans may have less leverage than they think\n\nThere is nothing wrong with Republicans seeking to use the leverage they won in a democratic election to try to further their political goals of cutting public spending. There are some GOP lawmakers who sincerely worry about debt and deficits – even when their party runs government. Plenty of economists worry about the always ballooning national debt, which has crashed through $31 trillion. And Biden’s big spending on Covid relief packages, infrastructure, climate mitigation measures and health care programs triggered a debate on whether he worsened the inflation crisis.\n\nBut are Republicans choosing the right hill for this battle when jobs, market-linked pension plans and the economic well-being of millions are at risk? The absolutist nature of McCarthy’s position pays little heed to a delicate balance of power. Democrats control the White House and the Senate, so in handing Republicans the House, albeit barely, voters might have been seeking compromise rather than confrontation.\n\nRepublicans are also facing claims of hypocrisy, since they had little problem raising the debt limit when Donald Trump, who rarely worried about making a big spending splash, was president. The 45th commander in chief is also on videotape dating to his White House days saying he couldn’t believe anyone would use the debt ceiling as a “negotiating wedge.” Republicans notoriously turn into fiscal hawks when Democrats are in office but often look the other way when there is one of their own in the Oval Office.\n\nMcCarthy needs to reverse the blame equation\n\nIn order to prevail in this fight, McCarthy has to somehow change the political dynamic by saddling Biden with the blame for any default and the economic tensions that could begin to unfold even before the country plunges over a fiscal cliff.\n\nHe tried to do so on Monday by insisting that the biggest threat to the US economy wasn’t a default but rising national debt.\n\n“Without exaggeration American debt is a ticking time bomb that will detonate unless we take serious responsible action. Yet, how has President Biden reacted to this issue? He has done nothing. So in my view, and I think the rest of America, it’s irresponsible,” he said.\n\nPrevious fiscal showdowns between GOP-controlled Congresses and Democratic presidents have often rebounded poorly on Republicans. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, for example, branded their foes in the House as economic arsonists and thereby gained political traction.\n\nMcCarthy needs to reverse the equation, which is why he’s trying to portray Biden as stubborn in refusing to negotiate concessions for raising the debt ceiling. The two men haven’t met for the last 75 days and the White House is sticking to its position that the place for talks is over a budget – which House Republicans are yet to produce – and not with the full faith and credit of the US government on the line and with America’s reputation as a financial haven at stake.\n\nMcCarthy is, therefore, in a bind. Congress, not the president, has the power to raise the government’s borrowing limit. Yet the speaker is demanding Biden give away his store over a duty that only McCarthy and his lawmakers can fulfill. No one would benefit from a default – especially not a president likely heading into a reelection race. But it’s hard to see how McCarthy can emerge from this conundrum as the winner if he triggers an economic meltdown.\n\nThe White House twisted that particular knife on Monday.\n\n“There is one responsible solution to the debt limit: addressing it promptly, without brinksmanship or hostage taking – as Republicans did three times in the last administration and as Presidents Trump and Reagan argued for in office,” spokesman Andrew Bates said.\n\nRepublicans in the Senate have so far tried to avoid the mess. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell did at least give his colleague in the House some moral support on Monday when he returned to the Capitol after convalescing after a fall.\n\n“President Biden does not get to stick his fingers in his ears and refuse to listen, talk or negotiate. And the American people know that. The White House needs to stop wasting time and start negotiating with the Speaker of the House,” McConnell said, though notably didn’t volunteer to get involved.\n\nMcCarthy’s speech on Monday only furthered the impression that a damaging political crisis over the debt ceiling is, after months of simmering, moving toward a boil.\n\nAs Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York put it on Monday: “He went all the way to Wall Street and gave us no more details, no more facts, no new information, and I’ll be blunt: If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction we are headed to default.”",

    "content": "CNN —\n\nThe 84-year-old White man accused of shooting a Black teenager who rang his doorbell in Kansas City turned himself in Tuesday and was later released on bail, authorities said.\n\nAndrew Lester, who faces two felony charges – assault in the first degree and armed criminal action – in the April 13 shooting of Ralph Yarl, will be arraigned Wednesday afternoon, according to Yarl family attorney Lee Merritt. CNN has reached out to prosecutors to confirm the information.\n\nLester turned himself in at a detention center Tuesday then hours later was released on bail. The conditions of his $200,000 bond prohibit him from having any type of weapon and cannot have direct or indirect contact with Yarl or his family, according to Clay County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sarah Boyd.\n\nRalph, 16, was shot in the head and arm after he went to the wrong address to pick up his siblings. He has been released from a hospital but faces an arduous road to recovery, his family said.\n\nLester has told police he and the teen did not exchange words before he fired at him through a locked glass door.\n\nThis booking photo of Andrew Lester was taken after he turned himself in to authorities Tuesday. Clay County, Missouri, Sheriff's Office\n\nCNN has not been able to reach the homeowner. CNN has yet to determine whether Lester has an attorney.\n\nThe criminal charges have brought a bit of comfort to Ralph’s family – but long roads lie ahead, both with Ralph’s recovery and the quest for justice, his aunt Faith Spoonmore told CNN.\n\n“It’s not as simple as turning a page,” Spoonmore said Tuesday. “It’s a little better that he is – hopefully – going to get part of what of he deserves.”\n\nBut questions remain over why Lester was initially detained but released a few hours after the April 13 shooting.\n\n“I share the outrage and concern of many in asking why,” Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told CNN.\n\n“In Missouri, you can have a 24-hour hold. It is clear here that this was two or three hours, where they questioned the suspect. He was able to go back home that evening.”\n\nLester told police he fired immediately after answering the doorbell when he saw Ralph pulling on an exterior door handle, according to the probable cause document obtained by CNN.\n\nLester thought Ralph was trying to break in to the home and was “scared to death” due to the boy’s size, according to the document.\n\nRalph Yarl From Instagram\n\nOfficers responded just before 10 p.m. that night after receiving reports of a shooting. When they arrived, they found Ralph wounded in the street.\n\nThe shooting left Ralph, who plays bass clarinet and is a band leader in school, with gunshot wounds to his head and arm. While he was hospitalized, Ralph told police he did not pull on the door, according to the document.\n\nIt was “nothing short of a miracle” that Ralph was discharged from the hospital, his attorney Ben Crump told CNN on Monday. But “he’s not out of the woods yet.”\n\nThe shooting fueled protests in Kansas City and stirred memories of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery – young Black males who were shot and killed by men who later claimed self-defense.\n\nDemonstrators have marched through Kansas City chanting, “Justice for Ralph,” and calling for the shooter’s arrest.\n\nThe shooting also came days before a 20-year-old woman was shot and killed in upstate New York after she and three others accidentally turned into the wrong driveway.\n\nWhile Ralph’s attorneys say the teen never posed a threat to his shooter, it remains unclear whether Missouri’s “stand your ground” law will be cited in Lester’s defense case.\n\n“Stand your ground” laws allow people to respond to threats or force without fear of criminal prosecution in any place where a person has the right to be.\n\nRalph’s aunt challenged the notion that her nephew’s “size” could be a threat.\n\n“I really don’t understand how,” Spoonmore said. “I doubt Ralph is even 170 pounds. Ralph is not even 6 feet (tall).”\n\nShe said she’s on a mission to help get justice for her nephew.\n\n“I want justice to look the same across the board,” Spoonmore said. “I want justice to look the same.”\n\n‘A racial component to this case’\n\nThe mayor said he believes Ralph was racially profiled by the shooter.\n\n“This boy was shot because he was existing while Black,” Lucas said.\n\nClay County Prosecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson has said, “There was a racial component to this case,” but did not elaborate.\n\nOn the night of the shooting, Lester was taken into custody and was released less than two hours later, two representatives at the Kansas City Police Department detention unit previously told CNN.\n\nLester was released because police recognized that more investigative work needed to be done, Thompson said.\n\nAttorney Crump questioned why Lester was not detained longer.\n\n“Nobody can tell us if the roles were reversed, and you had a Black man shoot a White 16-year-old teenager for merely ringing his doorbell that he would not be arrested. I mean, this citizen went home and slept in his bed at night after shooting that young Black kid in the head,” Crump told CNN.\n\n“He merely rang the doorbell. That was it,” the teen’s attorney said. “And the owner of the home shoots through the door, hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time.”\n\nThe mayor said he didn’t even know the details of the case until several days after the shooting. And while he believes race played a role in the shooting, he acknowledged the work by police – including White officers – who helped prosecutors file charges against Lester.\n\n“We did have officers, White officers for what it’s worth, who did a lot of hard work to get this case file to the prosecutor having charges filed shortly thereafter,” Lucas said.\n\n“That being said, to pretend that race is not a part of this whole situation would be to have your head in the sand.”\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nBefore the shooting, Lester was lying down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring and picked up his .32 caliber revolver, he told police, according to a probable cause statement.\n\nHe then went to his home’s front entrance, which includes an interior door and a glass exterior door – both of which were locked.\n\nA police vehicle is seen Monday outside the house where 16-year-old Ralph Yarl was shot. Charlie Riedel/AP\n\nLester opened the interior door and “saw a black male approximately 6 feet tall pulling on the exterior storm door handle,” Lester told police.\n\n“He stated he believed someone was attempting to break into the house, and shot twice within a few seconds of opening the door,” the probable cause statement reads.\n\n“He believed he was protecting himself from a physical confrontation and could not take the chance of the male coming in,” the document reads.\n\nLester said he immediately called 911 after the shooting, according to the document.\n\nProtesters march Sunday in Kansas City. Susan Pfannmuller/AP\n\nPolice spoke with Ralph while he was being treated at a hospital, where he told them his mother asked him to pick up his brothers at 1100 NE 115th Street, according to the document, which notes the actual address they were staying at was 1100 NE 115th Terrace.\n\nWhen he arrived at the house on 115th Street, Ralph said he rang the doorbell and waited a while before a man eventually opened the door and immediately shot him in the head, causing him to fall, the document says.\n\nWhile the teenager was still on the ground, the man then fired again, shooting him in the arm, Ralph told police.\n\nRalph said he got up and ran to keep from being shot, and he heard the man say, “Don’t come around here,” the document says.

    "full_text": "CNN —\n\nThe 84-year-old White man accused of shooting a Black teenager who rang his doorbell in Kansas City turned himself in Tuesday and was later released on bail, authorities said.\n\nAndrew Lester, who faces two felony charges – assault in the first degree and armed criminal action – in the April 13 shooting of Ralph Yarl, will be arraigned Wednesday afternoon, according to Yarl family attorney Lee Merritt. CNN has reached out to prosecutors to confirm the information.\n\nLester turned himself in at a detention center Tuesday then hours later was released on bail. The conditions of his $200,000 bond prohibit him from having any type of weapon and cannot have direct or indirect contact with Yarl or his family, according to Clay County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sarah Boyd.\n\nRalph, 16, was shot in the head and arm after he went to the wrong address to pick up his siblings. He has been released from a hospital but faces an arduous road to recovery, his family said.\n\nLester has told police he and the teen did not exchange words before he fired at him through a locked glass door.\n\nThis booking photo of Andrew Lester was taken after he turned himself in to authorities Tuesday. Clay County, Missouri, Sheriff's Office\n\nCNN has not been able to reach the homeowner. CNN has yet to determine whether Lester has an attorney.\n\nThe criminal charges have brought a bit of comfort to Ralph’s family – but long roads lie ahead, both with Ralph’s recovery and the quest for justice, his aunt Faith Spoonmore told CNN.\n\n“It’s not as simple as turning a page,” Spoonmore said Tuesday. “It’s a little better that he is – hopefully – going to get part of what of he deserves.”\n\nBut questions remain over why Lester was initially detained but released a few hours after the April 13 shooting.\n\n“I share the outrage and concern of many in asking why,” Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told CNN.\n\n“In Missouri, you can have a 24-hour hold. It is clear here that this was two or three hours, where they questioned the suspect. He was able to go back home that evening.”\n\nLester told police he fired immediately after answering the doorbell when he saw Ralph pulling on an exterior door handle, according to the probable cause document obtained by CNN.\n\nLester thought Ralph was trying to break in to the home and was “scared to death” due to the boy’s size, according to the document.\n\nRalph Yarl From Instagram\n\nOfficers responded just before 10 p.m. that night after receiving reports of a shooting. When they arrived, they found Ralph wounded in the street.\n\nThe shooting left Ralph, who plays bass clarinet and is a band leader in school, with gunshot wounds to his head and arm. While he was hospitalized, Ralph told police he did not pull on the door, according to the document.\n\nIt was “nothing short of a miracle” that Ralph was discharged from the hospital, his attorney Ben Crump told CNN on Monday. But “he’s not out of the woods yet.”\n\nThe shooting fueled protests in Kansas City and stirred memories of Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery – young Black males who were shot and killed by men who later claimed self-defense.\n\nDemonstrators have marched through Kansas City chanting, “Justice for Ralph,” and calling for the shooter’s arrest.\n\nThe shooting also came days before a 20-year-old woman was shot and killed in upstate New York after she and three others accidentally turned into the wrong driveway.\n\nWhile Ralph’s attorneys say the teen never posed a threat to his shooter, it remains unclear whether Missouri’s “stand your ground” law will be cited in Lester’s defense case.\n\n“Stand your ground” laws allow people to respond to threats or force without fear of criminal prosecution in any place where a person has the right to be.\n\nRalph’s aunt challenged the notion that her nephew’s “size” could be a threat.\n\n“I really don’t understand how,” Spoonmore said. “I doubt Ralph is even 170 pounds. Ralph is not even 6 feet (tall).”\n\nShe said she’s on a mission to help get justice for her nephew.\n\n“I want justice to look the same across the board,” Spoonmore said. “I want justice to look the same.”\n\n‘A racial component to this case’\n\nThe mayor said he believes Ralph was racially profiled by the shooter.\n\n“This boy was shot because he was existing while Black,” Lucas said.\n\nClay County Prosecuting Attorney Zachary Thompson has said, “There was a racial component to this case,” but did not elaborate.\n\nOn the night of the shooting, Lester was taken into custody and was released less than two hours later, two representatives at the Kansas City Police Department detention unit previously told CNN.\n\nLester was released because police recognized that more investigative work needed to be done, Thompson said.\n\nAttorney Crump questioned why Lester was not detained longer.\n\n“Nobody can tell us if the roles were reversed, and you had a Black man shoot a White 16-year-old teenager for merely ringing his doorbell that he would not be arrested. I mean, this citizen went home and slept in his bed at night after shooting that young Black kid in the head,” Crump told CNN.\n\n“He merely rang the doorbell. That was it,” the teen’s attorney said. “And the owner of the home shoots through the door, hitting him in the head and then shoots him a second time.”\n\nThe mayor said he didn’t even know the details of the case until several days after the shooting. And while he believes race played a role in the shooting, he acknowledged the work by police – including White officers – who helped prosecutors file charges against Lester.\n\n“We did have officers, White officers for what it’s worth, who did a lot of hard work to get this case file to the prosecutor having charges filed shortly thereafter,” Lucas said.\n\n“That being said, to pretend that race is not a part of this whole situation would be to have your head in the sand.”\n\nHow the shooting unfolded\n\nBefore the shooting, Lester was lying down in bed when he heard the doorbell ring and picked up his .32 caliber revolver, he told police, according to a probable cause statement.\n\nHe then went to his home’s front entrance, which includes an interior door and a glass exterior door – both of which were locked.\n\nA police vehicle is seen Monday outside the house where 16-year-old Ralph Yarl was shot. Charlie Riedel/AP\n\nLester opened the interior door and “saw a black male approximately 6 feet tall pulling on the exterior storm door handle,” Lester told police.\n\n“He stated he believed someone was attempting to break into the house, and shot twice within a few seconds of opening the door,” the probable cause statement reads.\n\n“He believed he was protecting himself from a physical confrontation and could not take the chance of the male coming in,” the document reads.\n\nLester said he immediately called 911 after the shooting, according to the document.\n\nProtesters march Sunday in Kansas City. Susan Pfannmuller/AP\n\nPolice spoke with Ralph while he was being treated at a hospital, where he told them his mother asked him to pick up his brothers at 1100 NE 115th Street, according to the document, which notes the actual address they were staying at was 1100 NE 115th Terrace.\n\nWhen he arrived at the house on 115th Street, Ralph said he rang the doorbell and waited a while before a man eventually opened the door and immediately shot him in the head, causing him to fall, the document says.\n\nWhile the teenager was still on the ground, the man then fired again, shooting him in the arm, Ralph told police.\n\nRalph said he got up and ran to keep from being shot, and he heard the man say, “Don’t come around here,” the document says. He then went to multiple nearby homes asking for help and telling people to call police.\n\nThe boy told police he did not pull on the door, according to the probable cause document.\n\nResponding officers also found the front storm door glass at Lester’s home broken, with blood on the front porch and the driveway, according to the document.\n\nThe teen “had to run to 3 different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up,” a GoFundMe page started by Ralph’s aunt states.\n\nA neighbor, who asked not to be identified, told CNN she called 911 after Ralph came to her door, bleeding.\n\nSince the shooter’s location was unknown at the time, she was directed to stay inside her home by the emergency operator for her safety.

In reality, he charged, Mr. Sun had “seller’s remorse” after trying to sell the paintings included in the deal, but finding they did not fetch offers as high as he had hoped.\n\nMr. Sun’s lawyers fired the latest salvo on Wednesday, telling the court that Mr. Geffen is “completely misguided” and should actually be suing the adviser, who they say has been detained in China since February “in connection with her confessed fraud and theft” — a claim that could not be independently verified.\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Sun, William Charron, said in an email that Mr. Geffen’s claims are “desperate and bizarre” and that he is clinging to a “fiction” that the adviser is not a thief.",
